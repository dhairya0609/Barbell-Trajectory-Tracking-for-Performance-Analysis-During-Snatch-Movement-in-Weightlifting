## Introduction

Weightlifting, especially during snatch lifts, requires precise technique to optimize performance and minimize injury risk. Automatic analysis of barbell trajectories can assist athletes and coaches in technique refinement and injury prevention. Traditional methods face challenges such as occlusion, background clutter, and camera variability.  

This project proposes a robust, camera viewpoint-invariant pipeline employing computer vision and deep learning techniques for accurate tracking and classification of barbell trajectories.

## Project Overview

This project develops a computer vision framework to:
- Automatically track the barbell during weightlifting movements
- Classify trajectory types based on movement patterns
- Extract kinematic parameters (e.g., height, velocity) for analytics
- Provide performance metrics to evaluate lift quality  

Key innovations include:
- Using MedianFlow tracker for stability
- Camera viewpoint invariance techniques
- Quantitative assessments based on recorded kinematic variables
